assets by the community for the community

Hi all welcome to the project. going to keep this for supporter's only at the moment


# Goal
Plan is to have a community of people create an awesome and large pack for Asset Forge. Current theme is trains.

# Guide/Rules:

Models should be uploaded here as either collada if a WIP or collada and .obj for the completed ones. This will enable easy cloning and editing of each block in Blender although any 3d program can be used as long as an obj file can be exported.

A matching .mtl file should also be uploaded with the obj file

All models are in this kit are made for asset forge so must be made within 1m*1m*1m blocks and align with each
other to stack together.

Familierise yourself with putting a custom asset in Asset Forge before adding to this kit please, just ask for help in doing so if need be and it will be given (Discord is best place for this)

# Foot Note
Just as a start i have uploaded a SketchUp file which i will break into its seperate items as collada soon

So thanks for being here and lets make something awesome.
